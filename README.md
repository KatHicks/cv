I'm a **full-stack junior software developer** with experience in **Ruby, JavaScript, Node, MVC, SQL, NoSQL, TDD and OOD**. I'm able to offer a collegiate teamwork style, great debugging skills and excellent communication from the get go - and you can rely on me to pick up new concepts or processes quickly and independently.

I'm looking to work with **innovative and ambitious people**, **develop my skills and grow as a developer**, and work on **projects that are useful and engaging**. I'm particularly interested in open data, data visualisation and social impact.

> ### Projects

You can see all my projects on [Github](https://github.com/KatHicks) and more work on my portfolio website [here](http://kathicks.co.uk).

| Project                                             |Technologies| :smiley:     | :confused:  |
| :------------------------------------------------- |:------------|:------------|:-----------|
| [Developer's Dictionary](https://github.com/KatHicks/developers-dictionary)     | Node, Express, MongoDB, JavaScript, jQuery, SVG, CSS, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai, Zombie & Heroku | We learnt all of these new technologies without any learning materials in under two weeks. | It would be interesting to extend the search feature to use fuzzy matching. |
| [FixCity](https://github.com/KatHicks/fix-city)     | Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Google Maps Javascript API, RSpec, Capybara, Sass & Bootstrap | I had the idea for this project and it was really fun to play with filtering by tag.| It would be great to extend the user model to include admin users. |
| [MakersBnB](https://github.com/KatHicks/makersbnb)  | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Capybara & BCrypt | We figured out how to upload images by ourselves without any gems.      | It would be nice to figure out implementing date ranges in bookings.|
| [Gabrielle Schwarz](http://gabrielleschwarz.co.uk)  | HTML, CSS & Boostrap | I built this website before enrolling at Makers and figured it all out for myself.      | It would be interesting to add on a content management system.|
